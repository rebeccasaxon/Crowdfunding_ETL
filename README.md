# Crowdfunding_ETL

Partner: Eugenia Volscaia

Note: my code is slightly different from my partner's code.

This repository contains a jupyter notebook that loads and transforms the crowdfunding dataset and creates four additional CSV fils. Those CSV files were used to create a schema and SQL database.
